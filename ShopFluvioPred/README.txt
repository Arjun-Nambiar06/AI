This project ties shop price prediction using linear regression model with frontend using streamlit, and with FLuvio.

The idea is to predict rise and fall in demand of products and their impact on prices so as to allow stores to restock and set the selling price according to it.

This is still a WIP as Fluvio hasnt been completely cooperative with the project despite multiple tries.
