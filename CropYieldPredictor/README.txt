This project is part of a bigger one where we create and app for farmers and predict the crop yield and crop prices based on the past government data as well as the newly input data by farmers.

Currently the file is made to figure out the most optimal model for our data. 

Next step is to understand, test out and implement Neural networks and NLP.
