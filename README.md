Welcome to my AI & Machine Learning Journey Repository 🚀
This is where I document all the code, projects, experiments, and learning milestones as I explore the world of Artificial Intelligence.

From the basics ➡️ to real-world projects ➡️ to advanced concepts, this repo grows as I grow.


🚀 Current Focus
Strengthening mathematical foundations (Linear Algebra, Probability, Calculus).
Building end-to-end ML/DL projects.
Exploring Generative AI & LLMs.
